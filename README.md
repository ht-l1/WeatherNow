# Weather

A weather app that shows the current temperature and condition based on user location using the Open-Meteo API. It is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It offers a few key features:
- a client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to see the weather condition based on their own geography
- a server-side API that fetches the weather information from Open-Meteo.com
- a web application that displays the captured information for each user

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
